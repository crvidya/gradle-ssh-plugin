Added feature: executing a command
Added feature: filter hosts by role
Added feature: executing commands sequentially
Added feature: each command should have independent environment
Added feature: executing a command with PTY allocation
Added feature: executing commands concurrently
Added feature: handling failure of the remote command
Added feature: handling failure of the remote command in background
